# [Devil's in the Details: Aligning Visual Clues for Conditional Embedding in Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05250)

Devil's in the Details: Aligning Visual Clues for Conditional Embedding in Person Re-Identification is submitted to CVPR2021. In this paper, we proposes a strategy that integrates both visual clue alignment and conditional feature embedding into a unified ReID framework. Instead of using a pre-defined Adjacency Matrix, our CACE-Net uses a novel correspondence attention module where the visual clues is automatically predicted and dynamically adjusted during training

Here is our another tensorflow implementation [CACENET](https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/PersonReID-CACENET).
